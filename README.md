Old Version
================
The old version was written many years ago.  It had a Java backend which ran on cron to download SEPA data from private database connection and put it
into SCA website Drupal database.  The Java source code has been lost so the site needs to be rewritten.  These days SEPA provides public CSV files which list the gauges and ones for each river with current readings, so we just use these.

tests
=====
./phpunit GrabSepaGaugesTest.php
./phpunit GrabSepaRiversTest.php
./phpunit GrabSepaRiverTest.php
./phpunit ScratchTest.php
./phpunit RiverSectionsTest.php   (note this needs a database connection)

database connection:
only used for data import from old drupal/java system which stored the river data in Drupal's mysql database
 config/database.php:
 <?php
 $servername = "localhost";
 $username = "scauser";
 $password = "xxx";
 $dbname = "scadb";

code
====
lib/Scratch.php  class to play around and test with
lib/GrabSepaGauges  class to download SEPA gauge data and return it as array, sepaData() is the main method to use
lib/RiverSections.php Class to deal with the river sections data, edit the data and export it as Javascript (most of the action happens here)
lib/GrabSepaRivers  class to provide and save/load json with current river readings, when it needs to update data it uses below class
lib/GrabSepaRiver  class to download current reading data for a river

admin/river-section.php  admin UI to set, add and delete river sections

TODO
====
- Download river data as an external process (takes to long to do it in sync with web page load)
- Deploy

PHP nuttyness
=============
We have to use PHP as it integrates with Drupal.

SCA server uses PHP 5, this may cause problems.

json_decode($data, true)  <-- use true here else it'll import hashes as objects not as associative arrays
